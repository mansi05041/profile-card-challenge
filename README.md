## My process

I use bootstrap for responsive part. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

```css
body{
  font-size:18px;
  font-family: "kumbh sans";
  background: bottom 40vh right 50vw url('images/bg-pattern-top.svg') no-repeat,
              top 50vh left 50vw url('images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg') no-repeat,
              hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-color:  hsl(185, 75%, 39%);

}
```
Setting background image is challenging.


### Continued development

Still need improvement with allignment & responsive part
